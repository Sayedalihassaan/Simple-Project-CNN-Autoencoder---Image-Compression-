# Simple CNN Autoencoder for Image Compression

This project explores the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to create an autoencoder for image compression. Autoencoders are capable of learning compact representations of data, making them suitable for compressing images while preserving essential features.

## Project Structure

README.md (this file)
requirements.txt (list of required Python libraries)
model.py (contains the CNN autoencoder model architecture)
train.py (script for training the model)
test.py (script for evaluating the model's compression and reconstruction performance)
data/ (directory to store image datasets, if applicable)
results/ (optional directory to store compressed images and visualizations)


## Key Features

Convolutional layers: Extract meaningful features from images.
Encoder-decoder architecture: Compresses images into a latent representation and reconstructs them.
Loss function: Minimizes reconstruction error to ensure fidelity.
Visualization: Examples of original and compressed images for qualitative assessment.
## Potential Applications

Image compression for reducing storage and transmission costs.
Feature extraction for other image-related tasks like classification or anomaly detection.
Image denoising.
